**Some information about Scribd documents:**

There are two types of documents on Scribd:

-  Documents made up using a collection of images and
-  Actual documents where the text can be selected, copied etc.

This script takes a different approach to both of them:

-  Documents consisting of a collection of images is straightforward and
   this script will simply download the induvidual images which can
   be combined to ``.pdf`` by passing ``--pdf`` option to the tool. Simple.

-  Actual documents where the text can be selected are hard to tackle.
   If we feed such a document to this tool, only the text present in
   document will be downloaded. Scribd seems to use javascript to somehow
   combine text and images. So far, I haven't been able to combine them
   with Python in a way they look like the original document.

Examples
--------

Scribd Documents
----------------
Downloading text from document containing selectable text:
::
   $ scribdl https://www.scribd.com/document/55949937/33-Strategies-of-War

(Text will be saved side by side in a ``.md`` file in the current
working directory)

Download document containing images; use the ``--images`` option (the tool cannot figure out this on its own):
::
    $ scribdl -i https://scribd.com/doc/17142797/Case-in-Point

(Images will be saved in the current working directory)

Scribd Books
------------
The below command will generate an ``.md`` file of the book in the current working directory:
::
    $ scribdl https://www.scribd.com/read/189087235/Confessions-of-a-Casting-Director-Help-Actors-Land-Any-Role-with-Secrets-from-Inside-the-Audition-Room

Pass ``--pdf`` option to convert the generated output to a PDF.

This will only dowload the book content available without owning a premium account on Scribd.
See the below section for downloading full books if you own a premium Scribd account.

Scribd Audiobooks
-----------------
This will download .mp3 of the audiobook:
::
   $ scribdl https://www.scribd.com/audiobook/237606860/100-Ways-to-Motivate-Yourself-Change-Your-Life-Forever
   
This will only download the preview version of the audiobook. See the below section for
downloading complete audiobooks if you own a premium Scribd account.

-------------------------------------------------
Downloading complete textual books and audiobooks
-------------------------------------------------

If you have a premium Scribd account, you can also download the full version of
textual books and audiobooks by intercepting the network requests your browser makes.
However, this also requires some experience on your side.

When logged into your premium account on scribd on the web browser, setup a
network proxy like Mitmproxy_ and install the SSL certificate so you can monitor HTTPS
traffic passing through the browser.

Now open any textual book URL (`example <https://www.scribd.com/read/189087235/Confessions-of-a-Casting-Director-Help-Actors-Land-Any-Role-with-Secrets-from-Inside-the-Audition-Room>`_) in your browser, your browser
will automatically make network requests to a URL that looks something like https://www.scribd.com/read2/.../access_token.
You need to inspect this network request, and replace the values for ``headers`` and
``cookies`` in the code `here <https://github.com/ritiek/scribd-downloader/blob/master/scribdl/const.py>`_.

You should then be able to automatically download full version of both textual books and audiobooks
from Scribd using the tool by running the commands as usual.
